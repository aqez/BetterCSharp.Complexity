# Complexity

Complexity is a difficult thing to manage in software development. Too often people get some code working
and never simplify it - resulting in complexity that makes it into the code repository. Later on, others
look at this code and instead of simplifying it for their new requirements, they add to it, resulting in
even more complexity. This repository is meant to be used along with the video <TODO: INSERT VIDEO HERE>
in order to show how to simplify programmatic complexity.
